## Description
Long ago, deep in the woods, the village of Soocrix thrived. It was not well known, at least, it was not well known to be real. Any self respecting Gum knew it was nothing but myths, stories told to little Gums to shush them at night. But, when you come to a clearing in the woods, beautiful and bright, colorful and glossy, its already too late. 

*Sugar sugar Gummy love, never ever look above.*  
*Deeper deeper in you tread, drips and drops around your head.*  
*Fire fire melts the bones, smooth and shiny slick they shone.*  
*Brighter brighter shines the light, steal yourself against the fright.*  
*Faster faster out you flee, stay low and soft beneath the trees.*  
*Sweeter still young Gummy heart, try to not be torn apart.*

The Swart live in the tree tops and drop down on victims. They covet the Gummy Bear’s colorful bodies and melt and cure Gummy Bear folk in a precise manner that kills the Gum (painfully) but maintains their bright translucent color and transforms their bodies into malleable building materials. The Swart don’t eat their victims, they make their world from them. Soocrix is a breathtaking village built into the tree tops. Beauty personified. Beauty made from the melted and mutilated remains of Gummy Bears.
