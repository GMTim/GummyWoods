## Description
The Gummy Berry Fields isn't what it used to be. Bushes full to bursting with the strange berry sprawled for miles in all directions, with no tree cover to blunt the sun's majesty. Historically, gummy bears tended the fields using ancient knowledge passed down generation to generation by their gummy forbearers (tee hee), but the nearby kingdoms of Man have long since over-harvested the fields. The bushes themselves still grow, and the fields are still a place of natural beauty and bounty -- indeed, portions of the fields have been given over to farmland -- but the berries grow no more. Gummy bears rarely travel the fields these days, as the lack of tree cover leaves them vulnerable to capture, and with no tender ministrations from the gummy bears the yield of gummy berries dwindled in time to nothing.
Thinking the associated aspect should touch on a few of the following: 1) the inherent danger of an open field, 2) the natural beauty and general bounty that still remains, 3) the fact that there are no more gummy berries here, but that with the right care, there could be again, and possibly 4) the encroachment of farmland.
