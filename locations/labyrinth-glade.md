## Description
The Labyrinth Glade is a moving feature of the Gummy Woods. It travels the wood looking for victims it can insnare in its maddening twists of brambles. The bears long ago learned how to ward their homes from the glade. But unless they are cautious they can still be snapped up while on the move. Few have found their way back out once taken. But those lucky few speak of voices in the glade. Some honestly trying to help, and other trying to doom. And itâ€™s hard to tell one from the other.
