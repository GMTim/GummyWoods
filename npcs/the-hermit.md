## Description
The vagaries of time have long since worn away this ancient creature's name -- for those that speak of them in hushed whispers, they are known only as the Hermit. Are they man? Woman? Gummy bear, human, or some other magical or intelligent creature? So too have such details likewise been stripped away by the scouring sands of time. It is known that they wander the same path as the tree, never straying far from it wherever it may roam. It is also known that they tend to the tree itself: pruning rogue branches, plucking and preserving its ripe fruit, and ensuring nothing shall interrupt its travels. Some contemporary scholars in the Kingdoms of Man posit this creature acts as warden, caretaker, and guide to the tree, the glittering waterfalls to which it leads, and to those foolish, brave, or desperate enough to seek the bounty it hides.
The Hermit is all of these things, certainly. But ancient story weavers, tale tellers, and wise men tell a different story, preserved in myth:  Such tales say the Hermit is a warning; a cautionary tale, whose fate is an example to be avoided. Such tales say that in times of legend a great but aging adventurer presumed to drink from the healing waters with the intent to pry themselves free from Death's coiling grasp, who's touch they could already feel in their aging body. These tales say the healing waters' powers are great indeed, for the adventurer could feel Death's grasp slipping even as the cool waters trickled down their throat. Death took notice, and its ire was great for it must always have its due. Although the adventurer's body was now beyond Death's reach, the same could not be said for their soul, and Death cleaved the adventurer's soul from their body in a single clean sweep of its scythe. The creature, now but a physical shell, despaired. But Death is shrewd, and merciful, in its own way: it offered a bargain to the pitiable creature. Just as Death plucked the creature's soul from its body, so too could it sunder their fear, their despair, and their infinite aching dread of an existence bereft of a soul. In return, the creature must stand as both a warning to and warden against those who would abuse the healing waters as they, in their pride, so foolishly did. And so, the tales go, the Hermit stands vigil. Whether or not these tales hold any truth, it is known that the Hermit is most gracious and polite to travelers and adventurers all, and seems most content with their lot. Most notably, the Hermit is all too eager to caution against misuse of the healing waters, and it is also known that most who descend into the tunnels to seek the healing waters never return.
