## Description
Straw Beary is a pale yellow Gummy Bear with black dots all throughout. She is tied to the Gummy Berry Fields by more than desire to see them restored, though that is her dearest wish. When Straw has access to gummy berries, her color changes to match the color of the fruit, but because the supply is so infrequent and minimal, she quickly fades back to her straw color. 
Straw is trying to teach other Gums how to revitalize the withered fields and the magics that may shield the berries from unending greed of the kingdom of men, because without intervention, Straw will wither as well.
