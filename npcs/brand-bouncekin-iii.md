## Description
His name is Brand Bouncekin III is from a long line of monster hunters. His bright green gummy flesh is pot marked by scars and abrasions from his many fierce battles with the foes of gummy kind. For the last few seasons, he has become obsessed with learning the location of Soocrix. Many have called him mad, chasing after children stories, but he knows it’s a real place. He saw it once, when he was young. And it’s haunted him ever since. Now, with years of experience under his belt, and an iron will few could match, he has set out on an expedition to find and destroy that wretched place.
