## Description
A Hollow is a gummy bear who was murdered by trickery. They are rare, as only a fully believed deception that results in death can create one of these creatures. A Hallow is fueled by rage and regret, and seeks to take its frustrations out on anyone it comes across. Before the time of Man, evil gummy cabals would plot to create these creatures and unleash them on their fellow gums. But no bear has intentionally created one in many hundreds of seasons.  
A Hallow looks like a normal gummy bear at a distance, but will avoid light at all costs. To that end they hide during the day, and will only approach the darkness outside of a camp fire. Their gummy skin is clouded and droopy, and their eyes are like two black pits. Unlike normal gummy bears they can stretch their bodies and become horrible clawed monsters, who bellow in rage and pain as they slash and bite at any gum they come across. They can be kept at bay with light, and setting one on fire will send it into a panicked rage, and cause it to flee into the night. This is only a temporary respite though. The only way to truly destroy one it to learn of how it was originally killed, and kill it in the same way.
