## Description
Lathi makes you itch. You itch so bad. You've never been so itchy in your life. You don't know what's come over you but you do know if you stop scratching the itch will consume you. Do you see it there? On your arms. Where did those branching spiral colors come from? But they're there and they are unendurable. Scratch them away. Scratch as quickly and hard as you can. Do you see the blood seeping out? That's right, that's the itch, you're getting to it. You must make it flow out of you. Go deeper, harder. Help those around you. Your sword is sharp and pointy and can scratch so well. Tend to yourself last, you are a hero after all.
